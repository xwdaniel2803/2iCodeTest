Assumptions made:
- Input is whitespace-delimited.
- Numbers input are between 1 to 100. The program will still work with numbers outside of this boundary.
- There are exactly 4 duplicates. If there are more than 4 duplicates, then the 5th duplicate and any beyond that will remain in the final output.
