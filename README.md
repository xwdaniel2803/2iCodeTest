Assumptions made:
- Input is whitespace-delimited.
- Numbers input are between 1 to 100. The program will still work with numbers outside of this boundary.
- There are exactly 4 duplicates. The program will still work if there are not 4, however it is most efficient when there are (i.e. the for loop in `removeDuplicates` is exited upon 4 duplicates being found).
